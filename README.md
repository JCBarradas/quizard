## Description
As an aspiring Forntend Dev, I was given the task to write the .js code for a time based quiz with multiple choices and highscores.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Upon loading the webpage on your browser you will see a Start quiz button. Go ahed and press it.
 
 <ul>Once you have pressed:
        <li>A timer of 60 seconds will start counting down.</li>
        <li>you will be presented with a question and 3 options, only 1 option is correct.</li>
        <li>If you choose the wrong answer 10 seconds will be deducted from your timer.</li>
        <li>The quiz will end upon responding to all qustetion or if the timer runs out!</li>
        <li>At the end you will be presented with your final score that will be saved into the local storage initials. </li>
        <li> You can erase the scores at any time by going to the Highscores page and pressing "clear scores".</li>
        <li>Have fun!</li>
 </ul>
 <ul> Bugs:
    <li>Havent been able to keep the quiz running by sellect an incorrect answer and deduct the 10 seconds from the timer.</li>
    <li> haven't been able to take the user back to the starting page upon submiting their initials</li>
</ul>
        


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
